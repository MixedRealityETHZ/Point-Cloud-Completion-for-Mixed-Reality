This framework extracts point clouds from the raw data by doing triangulation and subsequently using the transformations between the camera positions to merge the overall data into one full point cloud.

TO RUN:
Create environment (see requierements.txt)
Add the correct path to the data in the main function of the pointcloud_maker.py file
Run the full_pointcloud_maker.py script
